	<p>Thanks for stumbling onto my website! I've had the pleasure of working within several industries within digital marketing, business intelligence, e-commerce, SaaS, and even talent buying. Ever since I started my professional journey, I've been enamored by getting to know my clients personally and allowing them to use the proper platforms to help benefit their business. I'm committed to making sure clients succeed and it brings me joy to know that I've made a difference in their business. Outside of my professional career, I'm an avid music lover, I moonlight as a DJ, and a certified world traveler (ok, maybe not certified). Feel free to message me! I love connecting with others.
